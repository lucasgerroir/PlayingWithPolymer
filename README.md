# Playing Around with Polymer


I have been wanting to learn googles web component based library Polymer. I have decided to sit down and write out a guide for myself. After completing this guide I decided I wanted to apply the lessons learned. I found the following tutorial https://auth0.com/blog/build-your-first-app-with-polymer-and-web-components/  

I plan on taking the tutorial and making it my own when I have time. Maybe create a unqiue little web app.
